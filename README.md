# Responsive Web Design Project: The Next Web

> This is a Clone of The Next Web site, where responsive, web design principles were applied.

In this project we used different responsive web design principles, such as media queries, responsive grids, flex-boxes, and a clear html outline.

Background image techniques were used to make the images responsive while keeping their aspect-ratio intact.

We applied a mobile first approach in the design, with 4 breakpoints in total.
